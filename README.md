# Portfolio

Welcome to Portfolio Project. This is my personal portfolio, promoting my personal work and my personal brand.
Bellow will you find details about the process to finish this project.

## Introduction

This portfolio design was based on a High-Fidelity Wireframe and Prototype made on figma. Some creative decisions were necessary to adaquate the High-Fi Wireframes to a functional Web Portfolio.

## Creative Process

I started with the HTML and Bootstrap framework for the Home page. After the results were as desired, I started styling the page with CSS with a mobile-first approach, and finally, I added CSS Library for hover animations. There were many challenges with the Bootstrap Grid System and other small details throughout the process. I've referred to Web Development II Learning Material and other external Learning materials like the W3schools website and the Bootstrap docs to ensure everything looked like I had envisioned. I've repeated the process for the Work and Contact pages. The biggest challenge was the layout and toggle animations for the Work page. As my first time using JavaScript, it took me some time to understand the basic workflow and adjust the page to look exactly how I imagined.

It is noticeable that my Portfolio project is not identical to the High-Fi Wireframes. That assignment required me to create a portfolio website as a professional ready to enter the market and look for possible hiring processes. For this Portfolio Project, I've decided to make a personal portfolio with factual and accurate information about myself as a student and my work so far. For that reason, I've decided to remove the "Services" section and change the approach to the "Work" page since I don't have case studies to showcase.

There were also styling changes based on the feedback provided by the UX Design I professor. My High-Fidelity prototype had some accessibility issues with color contrast and the legibility of titles. Because of that, I decided to change the font family for the main titles and the background image for the main banner to enhance the user's experience and improve legibility. 

This project was a breakthrough in my learning curve. I improved my HTML, Bootstrap and CSS abilities and explored JAvaScript for the first time, which was a fun and rewarding challenge.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages.
- **Bootstrap Framework**: Used Bootstrap grid system, components and utilities.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and background images.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented interactive features for the Work page with the "Click to toggle" functionality.
